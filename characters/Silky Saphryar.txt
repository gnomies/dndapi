wooden staff

From a young age, Silky Saphryar had always been drawn to the divine. She was the youngest child of a humble family of halfling farmers from the small village of Saphrina, which was nestled deep in the woodlands of the kingdom.

At the age of six, Silky's family brought her to the temple of the local patron deity, entrusted to the care of the kindly clerics. It was there that she found her true calling - a deep devotion to the gods and their teachings.

For the next decade, Silky studied the teachings of her gods with the utmost dedication and sincerity, honing her magical abilities and learning to control her newfound powers.

It was during this time that Silky found her true purpose in life - to help others and spread the message of her faith. She took up a wooden staff gifted to her by the temple - a finely crafted weapon that had been used by her ancestors for generations.

When recent events led her to leave the temple, Silky vowed to carry on the legacy of her faith, using the staff as a beacon to draw and lead others to the right path. She travels the land, offering solace and guidance
