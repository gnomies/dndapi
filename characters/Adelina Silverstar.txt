Backstory:
Adelina Silverstar was born to a small family of travelling merchants in a far away medieval kingdom. Her parents were quite successful in their trade and Adelina was able to receive a good education, and even learn a few choice magical arts. Adelina had quite a fondness for singing and often sang stories of courage and heroism while playing her lute.

One day her travels took her to a temple dedicated to the gods of music and enlightenment. There she found a sacred censer atop a pedestal, curiously crafted in the shape of a soaring star. Without thinking, Adelina reached for it and suddenly the censer glowed brightly, calling upon Adeline as its beholder. The guardian of the temple quickly noticed Adelina's affinity with the sacred item and tasked Adelina with the job of playing beautiful music throughout the kingdom and promoting peace amongst the warring factions.

Adelina accepted the task and with her newfound magical powers, learned how to play even more intricate and beautiful songs. Travelling throughout the kingdom, Adelina was able to bring peace through her singing and the magical power of the censer. She was known as the Silverstar Bard and was respected and admired by all.

Adelina now carries the power of the censer wherever she goes, illuminating and warming the hearts of all those she meets with her beautiful tunes and inspiring stories.
